### Project Overview
This project involves using a Markov Chain model to predict the final league table for the Premier League 2024-25 season. The prediction is based on team-specific transition matrices that were derived from match results, considering the likelihood of a team winning, drawing, or losing future matches.

### Data Description
The dataset includes various match statistics for each game, such as goals scored (GF), goals conceded (GA), expected goals (xG), expected goals against (xGA), possession (Poss), and the match result (W, D, L). The key feature used to build the Markov Chain model is the `Result`, which determines the transition probabilities between match states.

### Model Performance
After training the Markov Chain model and generating predictions for the final league table, a comparison was made between the predicted and actual points for each team. The model's performance was evaluated using the R-squared (R²) metric, which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (actual points) that is predictable from the independent variable (predicted points).

### R-squared Score
The R-squared score for the model is **0.86**, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted points and the actual points. This score suggests that 86% of the variability in the actual points can be explained by the model's predictions. 

### Interpretation
- **High Predictive Accuracy:** The high R-squared value reflects the model’s effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns of match outcomes and translating them into accurate points predictions.
- **Remaining Variability:** The remaining 14% of the variability might be due to factors not captured in the transition matrices, such as injuries, managerial changes, or other unforeseen events.

### Conclusion
The Markov Chain model provides a robust framework for predicting league standings, and the high R-squared score demonstrates its effectiveness. However, incorporating additional variables or refining the transition probabilities could potentially enhance the model's predictive power further.
